# Machine Learning from Scratch
The code in this repository is written for the medium blog series Machine learning from scratch.

### Machine learning from scratch (part 1)
<<TODO: Link to medium blog post>>

The first part is built using algorithms k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and k-means. The blog post also discusses important machine learning topics to those algorithms.

### Machine learning from scratch (part 2)
<<TODO: Link to medium blog post>>

In the second part we build linear regression using algorithms Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Gradient Descent (GD) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).
